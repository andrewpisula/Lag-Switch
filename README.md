# Lag-Switch

I came across an old repository for a straightforward lag switch tailored to a particular game. I made some modifications, including adding an interactive console that allows users to choose which process to temporarily block internet access. I also fixed a few bugs I discovered. This is the original repo: https://github.com/sentoa/arma3-lagswitch/blob/master/ExampleApplication.CS
